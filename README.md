## MongoDB basics

Create a single file application **index.js**

  - Install mongoose

  - Create a **Wiki* model with the following fields
    figure out the types by yourself :P
    - title
    - body
    - author
    - date

  - Connect to mongodb
  - AFTER you connect insert 3 articles with random data
  - Retrieve one article
  - Update/change its title
